This portfolio showcases my work as a Staff Content Strategist at Walmart Global Tech, where I led the transformation of Marketplace API documentation. My core focus areas are API reference design, developer guides, building scalable documentation systems, integrating Git based workflows, and AI-assisted authoring to enable engineering teams and global developers to deliver and consume content efficiently and consistently.


## Case Study: Content Strategy, Engineering Enablement & API System Modernization
When I joined Walmart Global Tech, Marketplace API documentation lived across disconnected systems. It used legacy WordPress pages, inconsistent templates, and outdated workflows. Developers struggled to find the right information, technical writing teams wrote content differently, and API reference updates moved slowly through manual review cycles.

In 2025, I led a multilayer transformation across the entire Marketplace API documentation ecosystem unifying platforms, standardizing structures, introducing Git based workflows, and integrating AI-driven authoring. This case study highlights how I rebuilt developer documentation for Marketplace APIs, modernized reference systems, and enabled teams across Walmart Global Tech to scale content delivery with speed and consistency.

## 1. The Problem (Before)
**Fragmented systems, inconsistent structure, slow delivery**

Before the transformation, teams faced several challenges:

- API docs were split across WordPress, shared drives, PDFs, and internal tools.
- No single source of truth for developers integrating with Walmart APIs.
- API reference pages lacked consistent formatting, examples, or versioning.
- Updates required manual copy/paste and multi-step reviews.
- No standardized workflow for writers or engineers documenting APIs.
- Technical writing teams produced content in different structures, creating duplication.
- Code samples were mostly text descriptions not runnable, tested, or versioned.

**Impact:** Longer onboarding times, higher support tickets, and slow adoption of new APIs.

## 2. The Strategy
**Build a scalable, developer focused documentation ecosystem**

I focused on four key pillars:

### 2.1 Platform Modernization
- Migrated API Reference documentation from WordPress to GitHub + OpenAPI Specification.
- Rebuilt all Marketplace API guides in ReadMe, creating interactive, structured developer journeys.

### 2.2 Standardization & Templates
- Designed reusable API documentation templates to normalize structure across teams.
- Created “definition of done” quality criteria for every API spec and guide.

### 2.3 AI-Driven Workflows
- Integrated Walmart’s enterprise LLM into writing pipelines.
- Created a prompt library, Claude Code patterns, and AI-assisted templates.
- Automated troubleshooting content and runnable sample generation.

### 2.4 Engineering Enablement
- Trained writers, product teams, and engineers on:
  - Git workflows
  - OpenAPI documentation
  - AI-assisted writing
  - Developer focused content design

## 3. The Build (Technical Depth)
**Transforming Marketplace APIs across multiple systems**

### API Reference System
- Converted legacy reference pages into OpenAPI 3.0 JSON/YAML.
- Established version control rules using GitHub branching and pull requests.
- Added code samples generated using CLI tools + model assisted suggestions.
- Supported automated rendering in ReadMe using GitHub actions workflows.

### Developer Guides (ReadMe)
- Designed a reusable multi-page layout:
  - Overview → Authentication → Core Workflows → Error Handling → Rate Limits
- Created interactive workflow diagrams, prerequisites, cURL examples, and test cases.
- Rewrote fragmented content into task based developer paths.

### Reference Implementations
- Built clone and run REST API implementations in multiple languages.
- Provided authentication helpers, environment setup scripts, workflow examples (Orders, Items, Pricing, Fulfillment).
- Added inline comments, tests, and sample requests developers could directly extend.

### Internal LLM Documentation Systems
- Designed structured metadata models, task patterns, AI context bundles, and reference lookups.
- Documented how teams should use Claude Code for code generation, extension building, automation scripts, debugging, and API testing.

### Developer Readiness Score
- A scoring model evaluating:
  - Clarity
  - Completeness
  - Time-to-first success
  - API example quality
  - Workflow depth
- Used by teams to measure documentation maturity before launch.

## 4. The Impact (After)
**A unified, scalable developer documentation ecosystem**

- 100+ APIs documented using standardized, Git based workflows.
- 30–40% faster content delivery due to templates + automated pipelines.
- 25–30% higher documentation consistency across teams.
- Support tickets dropped as developers could self serve core workflows.
- International teams aligned on a single, unified Marketplace API hub.
- Engineers gained runnable samples and reference implementations they could trust.
- Writers and engineers now rely on AI-assisted workflows for faster iteration.
- Claude Code patterns became the internal standard for writing prompts, actions, and extensions.

**Scope:** Supports Marketplace teams across U.S., Mexico, Canada, Chile, and International Markets, creating long term organizational impact.

---

## 5. Extended Organizational Influence
**Scaling documentation excellence across Walmart**

- Trained technical writers from other product teams on Git based authoring and OpenAPI lifecycle management.
- Delivered workshops on developer focused documentation, quality scoring, and AI workflows.
- Onboarded new writers using standardized templates and best practices.
- Helped engineering teams produce cleaner API specs by embedding docs early in design.
- Influenced internal tooling decisions around documentation automation and LLM usage.

**Outcome:** Built a documentation culture that values clarity, reliability, and developer trust influencing cross functional teams across Walmart Global Tech.
