description: "Detailed portfolio of my published developer documentation for Cisco networking, Kubernetes, and HyperFlex hyperconverged infrastructure platforms."

---

This portfolio highlights my work as a technical writer for Cisco, where I developed API documentation, configuration guides, and workflow content for enterprise networking, Kubernetes platforms, and hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI).  

My contributions spanned developer workflows, REST API references, system deployment, and cloud-managed infrastructure.

## Networking  
Documentation across enterprise networking, secure workloads, routing, and cloud-managed infrastructure.

### Cisco HyperFlex API Reference
Created end-to-end REST API documentation covering HyperFlex networking components, including interface configuration, VLAN workflows, and cluster-level network operations.
Samples:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/ucs-dev-center-hyperflex/core-functionalities/">HyperFlex Core Functionalities</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/docs/ucs-dev-center-hyperflex/backup-service/">HyperFlex REST API for Backup Service</a></li> 
</ul>

## About My Work at Cisco

In my Cisco roles, I worked closely with:

- Product engineering (HyperFlex, Intersight, Kubernetes Service)
- API and backend platform teams
- Networking and systems engineers
- Cloud service and platform operations teams

I specialized in:

- REST API documentation (Swagger, Postman, OpenAPI)
- Developer workflows and lifecycle management content
- Cluster ops, orchestration, and infrastructure automation
- Enterprise networking deployment and integration guides
- Cloud-managed systems (Cisco Intersight)
- Hyperconverged storage and compute systems (HyperFlex)

This portfolio represents a selection of my published work in these areas.
