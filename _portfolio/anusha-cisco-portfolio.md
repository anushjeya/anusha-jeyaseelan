This portfolio showcases my work as a Lead Technical Writer at Cisco, where I developed end-to-end technical content for enterprise networking, Kubernetes platforms, hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), and cloud-managed infrastructure. I specialized in API documentation, configuration workflows, and scalable documentation systems that support engineering and customer success teams.

Key Contributions:
<ul>
<li>Created developer-focused content including installation and configuration guides, REST API references, workflow guides, and technical whitepapers across multiple Cisco product lines.</li>
<li>Defined and implemented content strategy for several networking and cloud products, ensuring consistency, scalability, and alignment with engineering and product goals.</li>
<li>Built and maintained internal knowledge bases for Cisco TAC to streamline troubleshooting and reduce case-resolution time.</li>
<li>Developed automated documentation publishing pipelines, integrating authoring tools with CI/CD systems to accelerate release cycles and improve content quality.</li>
<li>Enabled organization-wide GitHub adoption, training and onboarding 20+ writers on Git workflows, content repositories, and collaborative authoring practices.</li>
</ul>

## Cisco HyperFlex HX-Series

Cisco HyperFlex HX-Series is a fully integrated, hyperconverged infrastructure platform that unifies compute, storage, and networking into a single, scalable system. Built on the Cisco UCS architecture and powered by the Cisco HX Data Platform, HyperFlex delivers a high-performance, distributed file system with a single point of connectivity for simplified operations.

Designed for flexibility, the HX-Series scales seamlessly by adding HX nodes within one UCS management domain. The platform provides a unified resource pool that adapts dynamically to application and workload requirements, making it ideal for virtualized environments, enterprise applications, and cloud-ready deployments.

### Cisco HyperFlex Installation Guide for VMWare ESXi
Developed the official, comprehensive installation guide for Cisco HyperFlex on VMware ESXi. The content covered all phases including prerequisites, cluster setup, networking, and storage. Architected the content to provide prescriptive, step-by-step best practices, enabling system administrators to execute reliable, error-free deployments.
