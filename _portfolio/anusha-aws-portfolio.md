AWS Technical Writing Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work as a Technical Writer at Amazon Web Services, where I developed end-to-end developer documentation for AWS security analytics and threat investigation services. I specialized in API documentation, data lake ingestion workflows, and scalable content systems that support security engineers, cloud architects, and enterprise customers.

Key Contributions:

Created developer-focused content including API references, onboarding guides, data-ingestion workflows, and deep-dive technical topics for security services.

Standardized API documentation structure and terminology across multiple AWS Security Services to improve consistency and accuracy.

Developed cross-account and multi-Region configuration workflows for enterprise-scale security analytics.

Collaborated closely with engineering, product, and security research teams to support new feature launches and sprint deliverables.

Authored conceptual and task-based documentation that reduced customer friction and improved understanding of security event pipelines.
