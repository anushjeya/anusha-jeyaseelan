<h2 id="hi-im-anusha-jeyaseelan">Hi, I’m Anusha Jeyaseelan</h2>

<p>I’m a <strong>Technical Writer and Content Strategist</strong> with over 12 years of experience crafting clear, developer-focused documentation for <strong>cloud computing, security, and machine learning platforms</strong>.</p>

<p>I specialize in <strong>API documentation, SDKs, developer guides, and content strategy</strong> for large-scale products and developer platforms. My background includes working with <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> and <strong>Cisco Systems</strong>, where I created and standardized API documentation for services like <strong>Elastic Load Balancing, Shield, WAF, Firewall Manager, and Security Lake</strong>, as well as <strong>Cisco Intersight</strong> and <strong>HyperFlex</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m exploring ways to make technical content more <strong>interactive and educational</strong> — from integrating tutorials with <strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong> to automating documentation workflows using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>.</p>
